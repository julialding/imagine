Massive flames and thick black smoke are rising from the structures suggesting an intense fire that is fully engaged with the buildings. There are at least two children in the foreground observing the disaster they are standing on the street and are not in immediate danger but should be moved to a safer location. A fire truck is visible indicating emergency services are on the scene. Electrical wires are overhead which may present an additional hazard if damaged. There is debris scattered around the area which could impede access for additional emergency vehicles or responders.
