Given a text file containing descriptions and IDs from a CSV file, formatted as "ID {ID}: {description}" for each line, and a specific query, analyze the content to identify and return the top 5 IDs most relevant to the query. The query is: "Show me a big red house flooding." Use your understanding of the descriptions to determine their relevance to the query, focusing on the details provided in each description. Consider the context, nuances, and specific language used in the descriptions that may indicate a strong match to the query. Your task is to interpret the query in the context of the information provided in the text file, identify the most relevant IDs based on the descriptions, and list these IDs in order of their relevance. Use the following Python function if needed: import pandas as pd

def csv_to_text_file(csv_file_path, output_text_file):
    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)

    # Concatenate ID and description into a single string for each row
    # Assuming the columns are named 'ID' and 'description'
    concatenated_descriptions = df.apply(lambda row: f"ID {row['ID']}: {row['description']}\n", axis=1).tolist()

    # Write concatenated descriptions to a text file
    with open(output_text_file, 'w') as f:
        for line in concatenated_descriptions:
            f.write(line)

# Example usage
csv_file_path = 'path/to/your/csvfile.csv'
output_text_file = 'output_descriptions.txt'
csv_to_text_file(csv_file_path, output_text_file)
